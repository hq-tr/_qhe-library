=========== 2022-11-03 ==========
 - Added prune!(::FQH_state_mutable; tol) remove the basis with zero coefficients

 - Added invert!(::FQH_state_mutable) invert the state on the sphere

 - Added Base.-() subtract one state from another (missed out last time)
 
 - Changed variable types in all base linear algebra operation from ::FQH_state to ::AbstractFQH_state


=========== 2022-11-01 ==========
 - Added a function to calculate density on the sphere.

 
=========== 2022-10-14 ==========
 - Added Main.FQH_states.FQH_state_mutable. As the name implies, variables of this struct can be mutated freely after they are created.

 - Added AbstractFQH_state, a parent type of FQH_state and FQH_state_mutable

 - Added wfnormalize!(), sphere_normalize!(), disk_normalize!() to Main.FQH_states. These functions act directly on FQH_state_mutable variable.

 - Added collapse!(::FQH_state_mutable) that acts on FQH_state_mutable. This function collects all pairs of basis and coefficient in a given state; coefficients of repeated basis (if any) are added up. 

 - FQH_state_mutable and above functions are useful in the flux insertion routine. 




=========== 2022-10-04 ==========
 - Main.FQH_states.readwf() can now read wavefunctions with complex coefficients. The imaginary unit can be written as either "i", "j", or "im".





=========== 2022-09-28 ==========
- Address allocation issues in Density.jl and Main.FQH_states.get_density_disk(). Density calculation takes 100 times shorter.
