# _qhe-library
Tools for working with many-body wavefunction. Used in fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) research.

The main power of this library is in the class `FQH_states.fqh_state` which comes with an in-built inner product space structure (addition, scalar multiplication, and inner product). 

See [here](https://flame-pufferfish-834.notion.site/THE-FQH_states-LIBRARY-dd3e609edb674a09aeb1aec969ac17d7) for the complete documentation.
